Usage Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you're done shooting images, simply load the GUI and place the folder
and/or images you wish to process. Make sure to set your sequence intervals
to the number of brackets used during shooting or set it to automatic and the
script will detect the bracket sequences automatically (good in case your
bracket count varies across your project). Depending on the type of shooting
that was done, you may want to change certain settings in the GUI
